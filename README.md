# JognRTOS

This is a simple implementation of an RTOS, which serves as a learning sandbox. For now, all the code is written
specifically for the STM32L476 board.

# How to flash:

Currently, the only supported way of flashing the firmware is via a manual `openocd` insertion. Check out
_openocd_commands.txt_ for more information.
